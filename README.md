# Hi, I'm Iverson 👋

### 🌱 Junior Full Stack Developer | Continuous Learner

I am a newly hired **Full Stack Developer** currently finding my rhythm in the tech industry. I don't claim to be a master—I’m a dedicated learner focused on building clean, stable applications and growing my craft one commit at a time.

I’m currently focused on the **TALL stack**, but I’m always working to strengthen my foundations in core web technologies and database architecture.
